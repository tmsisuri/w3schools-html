        <!--you cannot change the display by adding extra spaces or extra lines in your HTML code.
            The browser will automatically remove any extra spaces and lines when the page is displayed-->

        <!--HTML Horizontal Rules-->
        <!--The <hr> tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule.
            The <hr> element is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page-->

        <h1>This is heading 1</h1>
        <p>This is some text</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>This is heading 2</h2>
        <P>This is some other text</P>

        <!--HTML Line Breaks-->
        <!--The HTML <br> element defines a line break.
            Use <br> if you want a line break (a new line) without starting a new paragraph-->

        <!--The HTML <pre> element defines preformatted text.
            The text inside a <pre> element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), 
            and it preserves both spaces and line breaks-->
